    This implements the EWA (Elliptical Weighted Average) splatting approach:
    1. Build 3D covariance from scale + rotation
    2. Transform Gaussian centers to camera space using the view matrix
    3. Cull Gaussians behind the camera or outside the frustum
    4. Approximate the projective transform with a first-order Taylor expansion (Jacobian)
    5. Project 3D covariance to 2D using: Σ_2D = J @ W @ Σ_3D @ W^T @ J^T
    6. Compute screen-space position using the intrinsic matrix

    Args:
        means: (N, 3) Gaussian centers in world space.

        image_height: output image height in pixels.

        opacities: optional (N,) per-Gaussian opacity. If provided, Gaussians

    Each tile stores **tile-local** pixel coordinates:
        px[i, j] = j + 0.5
        py[i, j] = i + 0.5
    Same grid for every tile. Per-Gaussian `mean_x`, `mean_y` in the packs
    are pre-shifted by the tile's origin, so `dx = px - mean_x` produces
    the same value as global coords would.

    Why tile-local: the kernel stores px/py as bf16 in CB_PX/CB_PY. bf16
    has 7 mantissa bits → for values in [1024, 2048) the representable
    step is 8, so adjacent pixels in right-side tiles of a 1920-wide
    render would round to the same px and produce identical output —
    visible as ~8-pixel-wide blocky stripes on the right side. Tile-local
    coords stay in [0, 32) where bf16 has sub-0.25 precision.
